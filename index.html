            <p>In this project my group implemented 6 algorithms and a visual interface to solve the differential equation model of Hodgkin-Huxley and aproximate the neuron potential.
                For this project I did the implementation of 5 of the algorithms and the plot of the action potential. You can visit the project <a href="https://github.com/0Jhoel/proyecto_final_prog_cientifica">here</a>.

            <h3>AlohAndes</h3>
            <p>For this project we implemented a relational database in Oracle for an accommodation business.
                Furthermore, we implemented a Java application that communicated using SQL with the database and with CRUD functionality to interact with the database.

            <h3>Music</h3>
            <p>I come from a family of musicians. So, naturally, when I was a child, I started to learn how to play the tiple. 
                The tiple is the national instrument of Colombia. 
                It is similar to a guitar and has 12 strings arranged in groups of 3, the 4 groups are tuned like the upper four strings of the modern guitar: D G B E.
                You can learn more about it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiple">here</a>. Moreover here are two videos of me and my uncle playing it.</p>
                <p>This one is a song made by my grandfather to one of his grandchilds.</p>

                <p> And this one is a popular choro from Brazil.</p>

            <h3>Chess</h3>
            <p>This is a new hobbie I picked at the start of the quarantine. I had already learned how the pieces move when I was I child, but didn't know some of the principles of the game. 
                Initially I started playing chess beacuse I watched some of my favorite streamers at the time trying it out.
                Then I started watching videos and streams of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/GMHikaru/featured">GM Hikaru Nakamura</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/GothamChess/featured">Gotham Chess</a>. 
                Those two channels really got me into playing a lot of it. Lastly, here is my <a href="https://www.chess.com/member/azmodes" >profile in Chess.com</a>, add me if you wanna play sometime.

            <h3>Manga</h3>
            <p>When I started highschool, I discoverd the world of anime. As I began to learn more about it, I came across manga.
                And learned that most of the anime I watched were based on some mangas with the same names. Since then I slowly stop watching animes to instead read the mangas.
                Now I don't really watch anime anymore but read a lot of mangas. Here are some of my favorites.
